Time Complexity:  O(m*n*4^k), where “K” is the length of the word.
And we are searching for the letter m*n times in the worst case. 
Here 4 in 4^k is because at each level of our decision tree we are making 4 recursive calls which equal 4^k in the worst case.

Space Complexity: O(K), Where k is the length of the given words.
