#Brute force approach:
TC: O((N*M)*(N + M)) + O(N*M), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
SC : O(1) as we are not using extra space

#Better Approach:
 O(2*(N*M)), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: We are traversing the entire matrix 2 times and each traversal is taking O(N*M) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(N) + O(M), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: O(N) is for using the row array and O(M) is for using the col array.

#Optimal Approach:
 O(2*(N*M)), where N = no. of rows in the matrix and M = no. of columns in the matrix.
Reason: In this approach, we are also traversing the entire matrix 2 times and each traversal is taking O(N*M) time complexity.

Space Complexity: O(1) as we are not using any extra space.
